This script calculates the clustering coefficient and degree distributions for a
particular kind of network growth.

It is a work in progress. Not at all finished yet.

The growth process:
Given an initial network. Pick a link at random and attach a new node to the two
nodes attached to the picked link.

After building a network the clustering coefficient is calculated, and the node
degrees are saved for later analysis.
